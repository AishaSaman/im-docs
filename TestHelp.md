1. What is metabolicMine?
=========================

metabolicMine is a data warehouse that integrates diverse biological
data sets and the tools to explore them. The main focus of metaboliMine
is genomics and proteomics of common metabolic diseases. By integrating
such data into one place it is possible to construct queries across
domains of biological knowledge.

See a List of all the data sources from the toolbar on any metabolicMine
page:

The metabolicMine user interface is designed to go beyond simply looking
up an identifier and viewing a report page. This quick tour will
introduce some of the features:

The first thing you’ll see is the **First Time Here** box. ![[First Time
Here]][]

Here’s where you’ll find our handy **Feature Hints**. Scroll through
when you need a quick reminder of the different parts of metabolicMine
and what everything does. Don’t worry - you can minimize the box when
you’re done with it.

Moving down the page we encounter three colour-coded boxes showing the
main ways of interacting with the database. On the left (in orange) we
have the Search box, in the middle (in green) the Lists and on the right
(in purple) our predefined Templates.

![[Function Boxes]][]

**Search** is available, just like on other sites, simply type in an
identifier to see a report page. You can search with identifiers (Gene
symbols, accession codes, PubMed IDs etc.) or keywords (eg. Diabetes)
and Authors (eg. Sanger F). Additionally, you can use Boolean (AND, OR,
NOT) and wildcards (\*) to refine your results.
