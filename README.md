This repo contains a Sphinx source documentation and theme. It is used by ReadTheDocs to automagically generate our InterMine site docs therefore do not go changing the structure of this repo or setting (much).

The markup used is called [reStructuredText](http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html).

As Gollum (GitHub Wiki app) makes a flat file structure out of all docs in here, some files (e.g. index.rst) will get overriden therefore use the Gollum interface only when you absolutely know what you are doing.
