This repo contains a Sphinx source documentation and theme. It is used by ReadTheDocs to automagically generate our InterMine site docs therefore do not go changing the structure of this repo or setting (much).

The markup used is called **reStructuredText** and guides can be found [here](http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html) or [here](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html).

The source for the theme can be found in the [intermine/design-materials](https://github.com/intermine/design-materials/tree/master/websites/intermine.org/2/html/sphinx) repo.
