Favicon
================================

Favicon (icon seen next to the url of the webapp in the browser url bar) can be set by adding the following line:

`<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="model/images/favicon.ico">`

Into the `webapp/resources/webapp/layout.jsp` file in between the opening `<head>` and closing `</head>` tags. Then, the favicon will need to be located in `[mine]/webapp/resources/webapp/model/images/favicon.ico`.

If you want to generate a favicon from an image, use http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/favicon/.
