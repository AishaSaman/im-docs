Query Results
================================


Upload look and feel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'''export''':  See "export" link below for details on exporting options.

'''column headers''':  See ClassAndFieldLabels to change column headers.

'''links''': Only unique fields (class keys) are links in results pages.  Add fields to ClassKeys to make the fields links on results pages.

Instead of linking to an intermine report page, you can set the links to redirect to external page.  See LinkRedirects

'''weird brackets''':  You may see the following in query results:  `GO:0007480 [GOTerm]`.  This happens when a column is a parent type but the individual result is a subclass.  The subclass will by in brackets.



Getting Code to Run or Embed this Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are able to get code in a number of languages. To access this, click on the "Get Code" button, 
which will present you with the different languages available. The javascript option enables you to
embed the result table in the form you see it in any other page.

The html code produced can be used as a standalone page, or as a template to extract
the relevant parts from for insertion into other pages.
