Query Results
================================

Content

.. toctree::

    export
    redirects

export
	See :doc:`export` for details on exporting options.

column headers
	See :doc:`/data-model/data-labels` to change column headers.

links
	Only unique fields (class keys) are links in results pages.  Add fields to ClassKeys to make the fields links on results pages.
	Instead of linking to an intermine report page, you can set the links to redirect to external page.  See :doc:`redirects`

weird brackets
	You may see the following in query results:  `GO:0007480 [GOTerm]`.  This happens when a column is a parent type but the individual result is a subclass.  The subclass will by in brackets.
