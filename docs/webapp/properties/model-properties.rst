Text and messages
========================================================

These files control much of the text in the web application:

InterMineWebApp.properties
   Most of the text appearing on the webapp (button names, forms, some help text, etc.) is defined in this file. If you want the webapp to appear in a different language than English, you will have to translate the file.

 model.properties
   Model specific properties. Merges with InterMineWebApp.properties, overwrites properties in that file
