Class keys
================================================================================================================

Specify keys for the types in the data model by adding it to the `class_keys.properties` file. This lets the webapp know how to define when an object of that type is "unique". Then you can:

* upload lists of this type
* when objects are in results tables, they will have a link to their report page


.. index:: class keys, links in query results
