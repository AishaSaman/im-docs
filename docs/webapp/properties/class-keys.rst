Class keys
================================================================================================================

Specify keys for the classes in your data model by adding them to the `class_keys.properties` file. This lets the webapp know how to uniquely identify objects of these classes. Users can then :doc:`upload </webapp/lists/list-upload>` lists of such objects.

Keys defined in the `class_keys.properties` file are also used to boost the search visibility of their associated classes.
