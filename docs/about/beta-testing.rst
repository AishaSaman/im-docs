Beta testing
================================

InterMine 1.4 will be released after the holidays. Prior to releasing the new software, we'd like your help testing. 

* Please test using the `intermine-1.4-beta` branch.
* If you've reported a bug, please let us know you are happy this bug is fixed.
* Minimally, we'd like you to release a webapp with the new software and test that it's working as expected.
* After beta testing, the `intermine-1.4-beta` branch will be merged into the master branch then deleted.
