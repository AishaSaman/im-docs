Do you want to create **open-source software that makes a difference**, using
cutting-edge tools?  This role will involve creating new features for the InterMine data warehouse platform as part of an exciting project. The successful applicant will be part of a UK consortium that is developing new methods for the emerging field of Synthetic Biology, and will be responsible for maintaining the current synthetic biology InterMine, adding new data, tools and features as required.

We have interesting problems to solve, both on the server and on the
user-interface level. We deal with the issues of describing complex real world
systems at the right level of abstraction. We work with the leaders in the
fields of genomic life-sciences, helping them structure and manage their
increasingly valuable knowledgebases. This data changes frequently, so we have
