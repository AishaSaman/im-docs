InterMine Development Roadmap
==============================

InterMine is a noncommercial, free software project, and as such there is no formal list of feature requirements required for development. 

We ensure that all new features committed to InterMine are thoroughly vetted by our community of contributors and committers.

Upcoming minor releases
------------------------

The InterMine project aims to make at least one minor release every quarter. If it becomes necessary due to an important bugfix or security issue, more releases will be made, so this list should be considered a minimum. 

The current schedule for upcoming releases is:

    Fall 2019 (4.1.0)
    Winter 2019 (4.2.0)
    Spring 2020
    Summer 2020

Next major release
--------------------

The next major release of InterMine is planned to be InterMine 5.0.0.
