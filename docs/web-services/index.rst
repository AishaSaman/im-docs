Web Services
================================

InterMine allows, and encourages, programmatic access to
its features, also known as *web services*. This allows
users to automate:

* Data retrieval (custom queries, templated queries, keyword searches).
* List creation/analysis/management
* User profile management

For a full listing of web service capabilities please see the
`HTTP API documentation <http://docs.intermine.org/http>`_.

API and Client Libraries
------------------------

InterMine exposes its functionality over an HTTP API (generally following RESTful
principles, but there is a bit of RPC there). Client libraries are available in commonly
used languages so you can get started quickly. All our code is hosted on `Github <http://www.github>`_,
and contributions are welcome. All InterMine code is free and open-source, released under
the LGPL (see :doc:`/about#legal`).

For information on the underlying API, and the supported libraries, please visit the following links:
