APIs
-----

InterMine exposes its functionality over an HTTP API (generally following RESTful
principles, but there is a bit of RPC there). Client libraries are available in commonly
used languages so you can get started quickly. All our code is hosted on `Github <http://www.github>`_,
and contributions are welcome. All InterMine code is free and open-source, released under
the LGPL (see :doc:`/license`).

For information on the underlying API, and the supported libraries, please visit the following links:
